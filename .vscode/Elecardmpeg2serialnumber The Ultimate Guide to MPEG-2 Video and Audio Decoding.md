Fortunately, there are some ways to recover your Elecard MPEG-2 serial number. Here are some steps you can try:
 
1. Contact the Elecard Technical Support team. You can fill out a form on their website or chat with them online. Provide them with your licensee name, your licensee email, and the date of purchase. They will verify your information and send you the serial number as soon as possible.
2. Check your online account on the Elecard website. If you have created an account when you purchased the software, you can log in and view your order history. You may find your serial number there.
3. Search your computer for a file named "ElecardMPEG2Plugin.ini". This file may contain your serial number. You can use the Windows search function or a third-party tool to locate this file.
