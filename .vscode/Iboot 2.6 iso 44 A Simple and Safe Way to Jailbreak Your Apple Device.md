2. Format your USB flash drive as FAT32 and rename it as "IBOOT".
3. Copy the iboot 2.6 iso 44 file to your USB flash drive.
4. Restart your computer and boot from the USB flash drive.
5. You will see a menu with different options. Choose "iBoot Legacy" for older devices or "iBoot" for newer devices.
6. Connect your iOS device to your computer with the USB cable.
7. Wait for iBoot to detect your device and display its information.
8. Press F5 to start the jailbreak process.
9. Follow the on-screen instructions and wait for the jailbreak to complete.
10. Your device will reboot and you will see a new app called "Cydia" on your home screen.

## Congratulations!
 
You have successfully jailbroken your iOS device using iboot 2.6 iso 44. You can now enjoy the benefits of jailbreaking, such as installing tweaks, themes, and apps that are not available on the App Store. However, be careful not to update your iOS version or restore your device without using iBoot, as this may remove the jailbreak and cause problems.

- Launch Cydia and tap on the "Sources" tab at the bottom.
- Tap on "Edit" at the top right corner and then on "Add" at the top left corner.
