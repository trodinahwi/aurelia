## What are SweetFX Effects?
 
SweetFX is a mod that allows you to apply various post-processing effects to your games, such as anti-aliasing, sharpening, color correction, bloom, HDR, and more. These effects can enhance the graphics and atmosphere of your games, as well as improve the performance by replacing some taxing in-game effects. SweetFX provides a consistent number of effects that you can customize and combine to create your own presets.
 
### Some of the SweetFX Effects Explained

- **SMAA Anti-aliasing**: This effect reduces the jagged edges of objects and makes them look smoother. SMAA stands for Subpixel Morphological Anti-Aliasing and it is a fast and high-quality anti-aliasing technique.
- **FXAA Anti-aliasing**: This effect also reduces the jagged edges of objects, but it is a simpler and faster technique than SMAA. FXAA stands for Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing and it works by blurring the edges of objects.
- **Explosion**: This effect adds a radial blur to the image, simulating an explosion or a flashbang effect. You can adjust the intensity and radius of the blur.
- **Cartoon**: This effect makes the image look more like a cartoon or a comic book, by adding black outlines to objects and reducing the color range.
- **Advanced CRT**: This effect simulates the look of an old CRT monitor or TV, by adding scanlines, curvature, noise, and color bleeding.
- **LumaSharpen**: This effect sharpens the image by enhancing the contrast of edges and details. You can adjust the strength and pattern of the sharpening.
- **Bloom**: This effect makes bright areas of the image glow and bleed into darker areas, creating a soft and dreamy look. You can adjust the threshold, radius, and strength of the bloom.
- **HDR**: This effect simulates High Dynamic Range imaging, which is a technique that captures a wider range of brightness and color values than normal. HDR can make the image look more realistic and vivid, by increasing the contrast and saturation.
- **Level**: This effect adjusts the brightness and contrast of the image by using a histogram. You can adjust the black and white points, as well as the gamma curve.
- **Technicolor**: This effect applies a color filter to the image, simulating the look of old Technicolor films. You can adjust the amount and saturation of the filter.
- **Cineon DPX**: This effect applies another color filter to the image, simulating the look of Cineon DPX film stock. You can adjust the contrast, saturation, and color balance of the filter.
- **Monochrome**: This effect converts the image to grayscale, removing all color information. You can adjust the contrast and brightness of the image.
- **Lift Gamma Gain**: This effect adjusts the color balance of the image by using three parameters: lift (shadows), gamma (midtones), and gain (highlights). You can adjust each parameter for red, green, and blue channels separately.
- **Tonemap**: This effect adjusts the exposure and saturation of the image by using two parameters: exposure and saturation. You can also enable or disable bleach bypass, which is a technique that reduces saturation and increases contrast.
- **Vibrance**: This effect increases or decreases the saturation of the image by using one parameter: vibrance. Unlike normal saturation adjustment, vibrance only affects colors that are not already saturated, leaving skin tones and other natural colors intact.
- **Curve**: This effect adjusts the brightness and contrast of the image by using a curve function. You can adjust four points on the curve: black point, white point, dark point, and light point.
- **Sepia**: This effect applies a sepia tone to the image, giving it an old-fashioned look. You can adjust the amount and saturation of the sepia tone.
- **Vignette**: This effect darkens or brightens the corners of the image, creating a vignette effect. You
