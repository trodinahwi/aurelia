Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN) is a mobile communications technology developed by Motorola that provides its users with voice, data, and push-to-talk services. iDEN operates on special frequencies that are allocated for public safety and business use. iDEN is used by many carriers around the world, such as Nextel in the US, Telus in Canada, and NII Holdings in Latin America.
 
One of the tools that iDEN users need is the Radio Service Software (RSS), which allows them to program, configure, and update their iDEN devices. RSS consists of two components: Carrier RSS and Depot RSS. Carrier RSS is used by carriers to activate and deactivate iDEN phones, change phone numbers, assign features, and perform diagnostics. Depot RSS is used by Motorola service centers to repair and refurbish iDEN phones, change firmware, unlock phones, and perform advanced diagnostics.
