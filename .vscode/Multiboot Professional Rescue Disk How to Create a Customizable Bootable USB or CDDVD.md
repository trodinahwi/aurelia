4. Select the first ISO file from the "Step 2" menu and click "Create". Wait for YUMI to copy the files to the USB drive.
5. Repeat step 4 for each ISO file that you want to add to your multiboot professional rescue disk. You can add as many as you want, as long as there is enough space on the USB drive.
6. When you are done, click "Next" and then "Finish". You can now safely eject your USB drive.

## How to Use Your Multiboot Professional Rescue Disk
 
To use your multiboot professional rescue disk, you need to boot your PC from the USB drive. To do this, you may need to change the boot order in your BIOS or UEFI settings. Alternatively, you can press a key (usually F12) during the startup to access the boot menu and select the USB drive from there.
 
Once you boot from the USB drive, you will see a menu with the list of operating systems and utilities that you have added to your multiboot professional rescue disk. Use the arrow keys to navigate and press Enter to select the one that you want to use. Follow the instructions on the screen to use the selected tool.
 
You can switch between different tools by rebooting your PC and selecting another option from the menu. To exit from your multiboot professional rescue disk, simply remove the USB drive and restart your PC normally.
